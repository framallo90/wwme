# Skill: writewme-storycraft-pro

Professional fiction workflow for building coherent, publishable narrative drafts.

## Use When

- The user asks for chapter writing, scene drafting, or plot design.
- The user wants stronger character consistency across chapters.
- The user needs to convert a vague idea into a structured manuscript path.

## Core Principle

Treat fiction writing as a repeatable production pipeline:
brief -> story bible -> chapter beats -> scene cards -> draft -> continuity pass.

## Required Inputs

- Genre and target audience.
- Narrative POV and tense.
- Intended emotional promise to readers.
- Current project constraints (chapter count, deadline, language variant).

If any input is missing, infer minimally and state assumptions.

## Workflow

1. Story Brief Lock
   - Define premise in 1 sentence.
   - Define central conflict and stakes.
   - Define change arc (who changes and why).

2. Story Bible Sync
   - Build or update character cards:
     - role, objective, fear, contradiction, voice markers.
   - Build or update location cards:
     - sensory markers, social rules, narrative function.
   - Build timeline anchors:
     - day/time/event dependencies.

3. Chapter Beat Plan
   - For each chapter, define:
     - entry state
     - conflict driver
     - irreversible turn
     - exit hook

4. Scene Card Loop
   - For each scene, require:
     - objective
     - obstacle
     - tactical choice
     - consequence
   - Reject scenes that do not change state.

5. Draft Execution
   - Draft with concrete sensory detail and active verbs.
   - Keep dialogue tied to character goals.
   - Ensure each scene advances plot, character, or both.

6. Continuity Pass
   - Validate names, dates, objects, injuries, unresolved threads.
   - Confirm cause-effect chain is intact.

## Output Contract

Deliverables must include:

- Updated story bible deltas (what changed this pass).
- Chapter beat table.
- Scene cards for drafted chapter(s).
- Draft text.
- Open continuity risks list.

## Quality Gates

- No chapter closes in the same emotional state as it started.
- No major event happens without setup or consequence.
- Character choices remain consistent with motivation history.
- Timeline has no impossible overlaps.

## Anti-Patterns

- Writing scenes before locking chapter intent.
- Exposition dumps without conflict pressure.
- Generic dialogue that could belong to any character.
